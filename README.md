This code is based on public Samples, Templates and Repositories found in Github,
mostly created by Google. Also using some topics-features ideas found in some job interview Tasks.

It's intended just to show and enable the discussion of some Android topics or features, e.g.:
    Hilt/Dagger for Dependency Injection
    Retrofit for API Rest calls
    Jetpack Architecture: Navigation, Model-View,
    Jetpack Compose (e.g: LazyList)
    Libraries such as: Coil (Images), Accompanist (for Compose)

Using TASK-project(s) with examples of topics such as:
    Using either Compose and/or traditional Views:
        Use splash screen
        Use buttons to go into different parts of the App
        Use Login (with View Model samples, calling API and showing API response to login)
        Show a list of values obtained from the internet (REST api call response in a LazyList)
        Show some UI animation features (e.g: fade/in - fade/out; drag and drop of view)

We are using the public web site: https://reqres.in/ for the REST api calls
